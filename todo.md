# To-Do List: Linear Regression Implementation

## 1. Data Preprocessing
- [ ] Load the dataset
- [ ] Split the dataset into training and testing sets
- [ ] Normalize/Standardize the features

## 2. Model Implementation
- [ ] Initialize model parameters (weights and bias)
- [ ] Implement the linear regression model function (y = wx + b)
- [ ] Implement the cost function (e.g., Mean Squared Error)
- [ ] Implement the gradient descent algorithm to update parameters

## 3. Training and Evaluation
- [ ] Train the model on the training data
- [ ] Evaluate the model on the testing data
- [ ] Calculate and log the final model performance metrics (e.g., R-squared)

## 4. Visualization
- [ ] Plot the training data and the regression line
- [ ] Plot the cost function over iterations

## 5. Code Refinement
- [ ] Organize the code into functions or classes
- [ ] Add comments and documentation
