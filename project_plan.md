# Project Plan: HW1

## 1. Project Overview
A project to complete the assignment HW1-1. This plan outlines the steps from initial analysis to final submission.

## 2. Task: HW1-1
The requirement for this task is "HW1-1". This will be broken down into the following phases.

### 2.1. Phase 1: Analysis and Design
- [ ] **Define 'HW1-1'**: Clearly define the requirements and scope of the task.
- [ ] **Technical Design**: Outline the technical approach, including algorithms, data structures, and architecture.
- [ ] **Create Test Plan**: Define how the solution will be tested.

### 2.2. Phase 2: Implementation
- [ ] **Setup Development Environment**: Prepare the necessary tools and libraries.
- [ ] **Write Code**: Implement the solution based on the technical design.
- [ ] **Code Review**: Review the code for quality and correctness.

### 2.3. Phase 3: Testing and Deployment
- [ ] **Execute Test Plan**: Run the tests defined in the test plan.
- [ ] **Debug and Fix**: Identify and fix any bugs or issues.
- [ ] **Prepare for Submission**: Finalize the code and documentation.
