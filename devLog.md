# Development Log for app.py

This log details the step-by-step creation and modification of the `app.py` Streamlit application.

## Step 1: Initial Scaffolding and Core Logic

1.  **Installed Streamlit**: The `streamlit` library was installed using pip.
2.  **Created `app.py`**: A new file, `app.py`, was created to house the application code.
3.  **Ported Linear Regression Model**: The core Python code for the linear regression model from `linear_regression.py` was moved into `app.py`.
4.  **Added Interactive Widgets**: Streamlit's `st.sidebar.slider` was used to create interactive controls in the sidebar for:
    *   Number of data points
    *   Slope `a`
    *   Noise level
5.  **Implemented Reactive Logic**: The script was set up to regenerate data, retrain the model, and update the display whenever a user modifies a parameter in the sidebar.
6.  **Displayed Plots**: The application was configured to display the linear regression plot and the cost function convergence plot using `st.pyplot`.

## Step 2: Feature Enhancement

1.  **Added Model Coefficients**: A new section was added to the UI to display the learned model coefficients (slope and intercept) using `st.write`.
2.  **Added Outlier Detection**:
    *   Calculated the absolute error between predicted and actual values for all data points.
    *   Identified the top 5 data points with the largest errors.
    *   Displayed these outliers in a table using `st.dataframe`.

## Step 3: UI/UX Refinements

1.  **Improved Sidebar Labels**: The labels for the sliders in the sidebar were updated to be more descriptive and informative.
    *   `Number of points` -> `Number of data points (n)`
    *   `Slope (a)` -> `Coefficient 'a' (y = ax + b + noise)`
    *   `Noise` -> `Noise Variance (var)`
2.  **Highlighted Outliers on Plot**: The main regression plot was updated to visually highlight the top 5 outliers. This was achieved by plotting them as larger, red circles with a distinct legend entry.
